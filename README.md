# SIAM-AN18-Tutorial on Consistent Bayesian Inversion

## This repository contains two examples prepared using Jupyter notebooks and Python 3.6.

### Ways to follow along with these lectures.

* If you are new to Python or Jupyter notebooks, then you may just want to follow along by opening the files we present in your browser (this should also work on any smart phone). You won't be able to execute/edit any code, but you should be able to view everything correctly.

* If you want to execute/edit code and you have Python 3.6 and Jupyter already installed, then download the files or entire repo to your computer and open them as usual. We recommend installing Python 3.6 for your OS using Anaconda to ensure that all files function properly. You can download the installer here: https://www.anaconda.com/download/.
